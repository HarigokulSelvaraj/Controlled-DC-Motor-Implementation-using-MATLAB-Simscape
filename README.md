Controlled DC Motor Implementation using MATLAB Simscape

●	Developed a complete Controlled DC Motor system using MATLAB Simscape, leveraging key component blocks such as DC Voltage Source, Controlled PWM Voltage, H-Bridge, DC Motor, Gear, Wheel & Axle, and Mass (Load).

●	Implemented PWM-based control logic to regulate the motor input and used an H-Bridge configuration for dynamic direction and speed control of the motor.

●	Designed and integrated a gear transmission system to enhance torque and speed, enabling efficient movement of a connected mechanical load.

●	Simulated the motor-load interaction to observe real-time behavior, focusing on torque transmission, acceleration, and system response under varying conditions.

●	Gained hands-on experience in electromechanical drive modeling, motion control systems, and Simscape-based multi-domain physical simulations.

●	Demonstrated proficiency in motor drive control, power electronics, and simulation of automotive subsystems, aligning with applications in electric vehicles, industrial automation, and embedded control systems.
